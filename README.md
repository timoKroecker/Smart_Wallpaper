# Smart_Wallpaper

This project aggregates and scrapes diverse content,
displays it in an appealing background image
and sets that image as a new desktop wallpaper.

Aggregated content:
    Birthdays
    Calendar appointments
    Expences
    News
    Weather

Tipp:
    It is recommended to set a scheduled task (e.g. on Windows Task Scheduler)
    for the execution of the program on your machine.
    Both a timed schedule at midnight and a schedule on every login
    are very helpful to keep the content updated.
